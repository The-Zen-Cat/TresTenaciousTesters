IMPORTANT:
You must be able to run python from the command line, and i believe you also need pip to auto install the way i set it up

run 'main.py' from the command line until you see ''bandit' already in sys.modules' outputed in the terminal

THEN, COMMENT OUT install_bandit() under the __main__ function, and uncomment run_bandit()
