run npm i in root directory or just install python-shell

IMPORTANT:


You must be able to run python from the command line, and i believe you also need pip to auto install the way i set it up

run 'main.py' from the command line (py main.py) until you see ''bandit' already in sys.modules' outputed in the terminal

THEN, COMMENT OUT install_bandit() under the __main__ function, and uncomment run_bandit()

now, when the main.py program is run from pythonShell.py, it will run bandit.
